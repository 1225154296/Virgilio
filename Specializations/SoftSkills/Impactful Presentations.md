# Impactful Presentations

## Why do you need to impress your audience?

In my days, in 50 B.C., data scientists were called [haruspexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruspex). 
The state-of-art technique they used to represent data and make decisions based on it was to spread the 
entrails of a bird on a sacred table and try to interpret them. 
"Such a small stomach? Aha! I'm going to tell the general now that it's time to attack decisively!"

But they always had that problem that they couldn't exceed an average success of 50 percent!
Today, fortunately, we have more effective tools and de-facto the core field "Data Science" is just looking at the factual evidence of the past to try to make better decisions in the present that affect the future. In the age of data-driven decisions, it is increasingly important to have a clear representation of them and how they advise us to act in practice. 

Let us give a few examples:

An e-commerce may want to understand which products are best sold, to what kind of target, in what volumes. 
It may want to understand which products are often bought together, so you can 
get the famous "hey, the other users who bought X also bought Y!".\
A newspaper might be interested in how age groups are divided and in what numbers, among its readers, 
and might also want to see at what time of day its articles are consulted and from what type of device (mobile, desktop, real paper?).\
A bank wants to understand what are the maximum margins that can be put on policies and loans, to find 
the best compromise between competitiveness and gain. These are just a few examples, now let's try to make a game:
try to think of any kind of human activity, involving more than 5 humans, that would benefit from a clear representation
of the data of their activity, to make actual decisions. 

You will find that this reasoning is applicable to anything, _if you have enough data!_

Extracting knwledge from the data, however, is useless if then the audience 
to which we must communicate(managers, customers, colleagues, departments) 
does not perceive the urgency of looking at the data to make decisions!

With this guide I want to introduce you to the key principles for effectively presenting your data and the conclusions
that can be drawn from them. Remember! Every decision you propose will always have a certain risk of not being the right one 
(the real world is based on unpredictable and chaotic mechanics and interactions), but the important point in all this is to 
get as far away as possible from the success achieved by the haruspex and their weak and random 50 percent.

During this guide I consider that you're presenting with the tech support of simple slides.

## Prerequisites

## How to build the content

### Know your audience

### Develop high quality content
The content is the nucleus of your presentation. While all the other ideas below will help you make your content more effective, a great presentation starts and ends with great content. So don't shorten your audience by shortening the effort you spend developing your content. You will need to invest many hours of research, writing and asking feedbacks if you want to create a presentation that your audience will love. You want to refine your material as more as you can, but don't over prepare 
everythint, otherwise you'll seem too much rigid and artificial: we'll see that one of the key points in this guide 
will be "be authentic".

### Build a 3steps structure
Although not all presentations fit easily into the 3-act structure, it is generally a good general method to follow.

Step 1 - The first Step is the introduction, the setting of the presentation. This is the moment when you capture the audience's attention, giving them the expectation of what will come out of it and a reason to keep listening.

Step 2 - The intermediate Step is the moment when you support their interest. You are usually detailing a problem and offering a solution while you educate and inform along the way. It is here where you truly build your case and sell the benefits. This is where you want to provide compelling examples, data, statistics, etc. to support your points.

Step 3 - The final Step is where you solve the problem, summarizes it and reminds the audience of the highlights of your presentation. Then leave the audience with a call to action and a list of practical points. What is supposed to be taken away from your presentation by the audience? This should be clearly defined in the closing Step. In addition, a final story or illustration and questions from the audience are a great way to end the presentation and help people remember the sense of your discourse.

### Less is more
Packing slides with information does not necessarily make them more effective. In fact, you often get the opposite effect by producing confusing slides that take away, rather than adding value to a  presentation.
Well-designed slides help the speaker to emphasize his or her point of view and the audience to understand the key steps of a presentation. Follow the principle of ["Less is More"](https://www.presentation-guru.com/when-it-comes-to-presentations-less-is-more/).

### Leverage data power wisely
According to SpiderMan's uncle:
> from great power comes great responsibility.
The data can be of help or your enemies during a presentation, depending on how you use them and especially you show them graphically. Don't put too much data in your presentation (remember, Less is More)!
First, take this [awesome read](https://moz.com/blog/data-visualization-principles-lessons-from-tufte), then 
find [here](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/talks/datavisualization/datavisualization.pdf) you great examples of what I'm saying. 

## How to present the content

### Don’t read
Really, don't do it. Reading slides will bore your audience and you'll seem less confident.
[Here's](https://www.techwell.com/2013/10/give-better-presentation-don-t-read-your-slides) why.
[Here's](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/76370/why-do-most-people-think-its-a-bad-idea-to-read-from-slides) a mine full of other reasons.
